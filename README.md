# Real-TIme-Solar-Tracking-Modelling-and-Optimization-of-Solar-Panel

This project was created using Matlab Simulink. Matlab Simulink is a tool to model physical systems. In this project using set of defined equations for motor control and Solar panel, a solar tracking system was constructed that allows axial movement of solar panel to get maximum amount of solar irradiation. Moreover any real time data can be uploaded as well as input signal.
